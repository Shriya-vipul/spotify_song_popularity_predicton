In this project, we managed to categorize the songs into clusters, interpret the profile of
each cluster, predict the popularity score for songs in each cluster, and compare the mean
popularity score across clusters.

The first technique we employed was clustering analysis. Based upon our focus on the
prediction power of songs' audio features in relation to the songs' popularity score and the results
of exploratory data analysis, we dropped: time_signature(as most songs have a value of 4),
loudness(strongly correlated with energy), liveness(a dummy variable indicating whether the
song is live performance), tempo(beats per minute which is ambiguous to decide the speed of the
song), key(a pitch class notation) and mode(only used during music composition).
